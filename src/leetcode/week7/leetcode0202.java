     *
     * Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy"
     *
     * A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace
     * the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where
     * it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those nunmbers for which this
     * process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
     *
     * Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.
     *
     * Example:
     * Input: 19
     * Output: true
     * Explanation:
     * 1 squares + 9 squares = 82
     * 8 squares + 2 squares = 68
     * 6 squares + 8 squares = 100
     * 1 squares + 0 squares + 0 squares = 1
